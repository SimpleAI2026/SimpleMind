# SimpleMind

English | [中文](./README.md)

A free, in-browser mind mapping tool. The app opens on a **Home** page of template cards; in the editor, select a node and generate child nodes through an **OpenAI-compatible** Chat Completions API.

- Live demo: https://simple-mind-five.vercel.app
- Repository: https://github.com/linkxzhou/SimpleMind

Stack: Vue 3, Vite 7, Ant Design Vue 4, vue-router, [simple-mind-map](https://github.com/wanglin2/mind-map).

## Screenshots (samples)

Sample screenshots of the product after the homepage redesign.

### Home

![Home sample](./ScreenShot1.png)

Brand **SimpleMind** on the left; language and theme selectors on the right. The main area is a “Create” card plus a grid of thinking-template example cards.

### Mind map

![Mind map sample](./ScreenShot2.png)

Editor (`/map`) shows the mind map. The toolbar includes back to Home, zoom, undo/redo, add/remove nodes, import/export, detailed/simple mode, card view, settings, and AI Generate (no “Set Thinking Template” toolbar entry).

### Card view

![Card view sample](./ScreenShot3.png)

Renders the map as layered, document-style cards; can also be exported as a standalone `card.html`.

## Features

### Home and navigation

- **Default route `/`**: tech-style Home page (not the canvas).
- **Header**: brand `SimpleMind` on the left; language and theme dropdowns on the right (same theme list as Settings via `getThemeList()`).
- **Template card grid**: first card is always “Create (+)”; remaining cards are flattened thinking-template examples (note-taking, course learning, first principles, Feynman technique, Bayesian thinking, critical thinking, code generation, and more).
- **Enter editor**: “Create” → `/map` with a new map; a template card → `/map` with that example loaded. To switch templates, go back to Home.
- **Back to Home**: explicit control at the start of the editor toolbar.

### AI generation

- **Thinking templates**: Default (general summary), note-taking, course learning, first principles, Feynman technique, Bayesian thinking, critical thinking, and code generation. Templates are applied when opening from a Home card; rules can still be reviewed in Settings.
- **Generate children**: Select a node and click **AI Generate**. Child nodes are inserted from the node text, current template, and knowledge base (default two-level structure: first level + `children`). “Min nodes per generation” is 1–20 (default 5).
- **Knowledge base**: Enter system context in Settings, or upload `.md` / `.txt` / `.csv` / `.pdf` (parsed to text, truncated at about 20,000 characters).
- **AI expand**: Send the current knowledge base to the model to expand it before generation.
- **Models**: Settings includes `GLM-5.3`, `Qwen3.8-27B`, and `DeepSeek-V4-Flash`. If no env var is set, the default is `Qwen/Qwen3.8-27B`. Other model IDs can be supplied via environment variables.

### Editing and views

- **Toolbar**: back to Home, zoom (desktop), undo/redo, new map, add/remove nodes, import/export, detailed/simple mode, card view, settings, AI generate (**no** “Set Thinking Template” toolbar button).
- **Layouts**: mind map, logical structure, organization chart, catalog organization, timeline, fishbone.
- **Detailed / simple mode**: detailed mode appends the node note to the text; simple mode keeps the title only.
- **Card view**: renders the map as layered cards; can also be exported as a standalone `card.html`.
- **Node actions**: context menu supports add child, remove current node, remove node with children, copy / cut / paste, mark / unmark.
- **Theme and style**: built-in themes (default `mint`); custom canvas background, line color and width (1–10px), line style (curve / straight / direct), and font (Microsoft YaHei, SimSun, KaiTi, SimHei, LiSu, Arial, and others). Each style can be reset independently.
- **Language**: Simplified Chinese and English. Mouse-wheel zoom and node drag are enabled.

### Import, export, and storage

- **Export**: `.smm`, `.json`, `.svg`, `.png`, `.pdf`, `.md`, `.xmind`, `.txt`, `card.html`.
- **Import**: `.smm`, `.json`, `.xmind`, `.md`. The UI also lists `.xlsx`, but parsing is not implemented.
- **Persistence**: settings and map data are stored in the current tab’s `sessionStorage` and are lost when the tab is closed.

## Requirements

- Node.js `^20.19.0` or `>=22.12.0`
- Yarn (the repo includes `yarn.lock`)

## Setup

```sh
yarn
```

Development:

```sh
yarn dev
```

Production build:

```sh
yarn build
```

Preview the production build:

```sh
yarn preview
```

## Environment variables

Create `.env` or `.env.local` in the project root (`.env.local` is gitignored). These values are only **initial defaults** for the settings panel; they can still be changed in the UI.

The app appends `/chat/completions` to `VITE_API`, so the Base URL must **not** include that path, and should not have a trailing slash.

| Variable | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `VITE_API` | Base URL of an OpenAI-compatible API | `https://api.openai.com/v1` or `https://api.siliconflow.cn/v1` |
| `VITE_SECRET` | API key, sent as `Authorization: Bearer ...` | `sk-xxxxxxxx` |
| `VITE_MODEL` | Default model ID | `Qwen/Qwen3.8-27B` |

Example:

```
VITE_API=https://api.openai.com/v1
VITE_SECRET=sk-xxxxxxxx
VITE_MODEL=Qwen/Qwen3.8-27B
```

You can skip env files and fill in API Base, secret, and model in Settings before clicking **AI Generate**. Generation prompts you to configure API Base if it is empty.

## Usage

1. Open the app on Home and optionally set language / theme in the header.
2. Click **Create** for a blank map, or open a template card to load an example into the editor.
3. Configure the API via env vars or the settings panel.
4. Select the root node or any node and set its text to the topic you want to expand; optionally add material in **Knowledge Base**.
5. Click **AI Generate**. Child nodes are inserted under the selected node. To switch thinking templates, use **Back to Home** and pick another card.

## Implementation notes

- Model JSON is often invalid; the app already repairs it with [`jsonrepair`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonrepair) before parsing.
- The official `simple-mind-map` `TouchEvent` plugin binds touch handlers on `window` and blocks Ant Design Vue controls on mobile. This repo uses `src/plugins/TouchEvent.js`, which ignores touches whose target is outside the mind-map container.
- Routes: `/` → Home, `/map` → Editor.
